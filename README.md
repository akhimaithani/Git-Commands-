# Git-Commands

## $git config

You can use it to configure the author's name, email address, file formats and many more to be used with your commits.
git config --global user.name "Pushpank"
git config --global user.email "pushpank@gmail.com"

## $git init

Using this command you make it sure that your git repository is initialized and creates the initial .git directory in a new or in an existing project. The output will be the following:
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/.git/

#### Note. You can undo a $git init with rm -rf .git.
